# Task-Manager-Web-Application
A lightweight web application developed with JavaScript for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and SQL as the database. Users can log in, add tasks, edit, and delete them, making task management simple and efficient.
The login and registration pages are built using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** for the frontend. The backend is developed using **Node.js**, where **Express.js** is used to create APIs that connect to an **SQL database**. These APIs handle user registration and authentication.
